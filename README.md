## üßæ Course Overview

This course is designed to equip statisticians and researchers in financial institutions with practical and theoretical skills in **Machine Learning (ML)** using **R and Python**. It follows a structured learning path from foundational concepts to advanced applications in macroeconomics, banking, and financial markets.

Participants engage in:

- Hands-on coding exercises  
- Case-based learning  
- Real-world datasets  
- A final capstone project tied to financial problem-solving
